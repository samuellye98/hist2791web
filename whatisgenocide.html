                              <p style="text-align:justify">Humanity is a mosaic of peoples and cultures. We all have a shared humanity, and we all have a stake in preserving our shared humanity. Whenever a part of our mosaic is irreversibly cracked or removed, the entire mosaic is defaced. We are all worse off for it. If a nation is unable to uphold their responsibility to protect their people, the nationâ€™s right to claim sovereignty over its people is also in doubt.</p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify">Preserving this mosaic is of utmost priority; the prevention of genocide should take precedence over many other goals of action. The unfortunate cases after cases of genocide in the 20th century prove that the expansion of human rights and humanitarianism is not inevitable - we need to fight for it. Human beings, as Elizabeth Neuffer states, have an inherent need to justice. Our common histories fluctuate between victories and reversal. The struggle never stops; our struggle should not stop. There can be no peace without justice.</p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify">Genocide can be usefully defined as the radical diminishment of a people and its culture. It is accompanied by mass killings and, usually, expulsions. To end a genocide, we must return the target population to conditions of human security similar to what they possessed prior to coming under seige. To do so, therefore, requires a sensitivity to genocide.</p>
