                              <p style="text-align:justify">Much of the Cambodian targeted ethnic minorities, creating a systematic writing-off of racial minorities, such as the Chinese, Vietnamese and 21 other minority groups. Those who were not able to leave the country were simply murdered. Even now, the population of Vietnamese in Cambodia has yet to hit 200,000 - half of the pre-genocide number. Deliberate repression and execution took the lives of more than â…“ of the Cham minority population during the years of the genocide.</p>


                        <p style="text-align:justify">While a certain level of cultural discrimination exists in Cambodia even today, it is clear that ethnic minorities have come a long way in regaining their identity as part of the cambodian community. While they are not allowed to be members of the ruling political party, they are welcomed into other parties, and are treated the same as the ethnic majority - Khmers.</p>
