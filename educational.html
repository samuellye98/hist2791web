                              <p style="text-align:justify">In 2017, after anti-cheating reforms were introduced into the countryâ€™s national exam, 70% of the students sitting for the exam failed. This shows that almost 40 years of the genocide, the country still has a long way to go on its road to recovery.  Much higher Student to Teacher ratio that South East Asian neighbors Vietnam and Laos. Much less investment GPD percent wise than Southeast Asian Neighbors. Much of this stems from the fact that the Khmer Rouge regime deliberately targeted the educated classes of the population. Before the Khmer Rouge party took power, Prince Sihanouk had focused on an educated society - this changed very rapidly when the Khmer Rouge took power, and unfortunately, the effect has been very long lasting. In 2001, nearly 25 years after the genocide, only 25% or survey respondents replied that they had any form of secondary schooling. There was still 20% who had never received any education at all.</p>

                              <p style="text-align:justify">Recently, however, Cambodia has taken steps towards improving their education system, increasing the basic wage paid to teachers and investing more in the education sector. Hopefully, this leads to positive change in the near future.</p>
