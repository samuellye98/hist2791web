                              <p style="text-align:justify">The theoretical model of the 8 stages of genocide (later expanded to 10) is a useful tool for identifying genocides and recommending stage-specific solutions. To be certain, it is not a definitive guide. In creating this model, Gregory Stanton wished only to provoke thinking about the somewhat predictability of genocide and to develop a framework that is applicable on-the-ground. Genocides do not always develop in “stages”; sometimes, it is a simultaneous process that cuts across stages. If anything, history has taught us that we can expect genocides to follow a certain path and have a certain predictability, but that we often underestimate the rapidity of their development. We are frequently in a position to preempt the full development of genocide and thus have the moral imperative to act with urgency and alacrity.</p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify"><b>1. CLASSIFICATION:</b> All cultures have binaries that split people into “us and them,” whether by ethnicity, race, religion, or nationality. However, societies that lack mixed categories are the most likely to have genocide. As such, the main preventive measure at this early stage is to transcend this perceived division and find a common ground. More specifically, universalistic institutions can be developed. In Tanzania, for instance, the promotion of a common language has promoted a transcendent national identity.</p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify"><b>2. SYMBOLIZATION:</b> Classifications are often infused with symbolic importance. In the process of distinguishing groups of people, we often end up essentializing and reducing them to that singular social identity. There is thus the risk of dehumanization. Symbolizations that are forced onto people, like the blue scarf for people from the Eastern Zone in Khmer Rouge Cambodia, only serve to encourage dehumanizing. To combat symbolization, hate symbols and hate speech should be outlawed. Group marking and other forms of tribalizing should also be prevented by legal institutions and supported by popular cultural enforcement. The latter is important, because replacement words may emerge - a case in point is Burundi, where code words emerged to replace the words “Hutu” and “Tutsi.”</p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify"><b>3. DISCRIMINATION:</b> Discimination is an act of power. A dominant group may use legal and political means to deny other groups their civil rights or even citizenship. The Nuremberg Laws of 1935 Nazi Germany, for example, stripped Jews of their German citizenship and prevented them from being employed in government and by universities.  A contemporary example is the denial of citizenship to the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar. Legal discrimination anchored in false ideas of difference and stemming from nationality, ethnicity, race or religion should not be accepted by the international community.</p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify"><b>4. DEHUMANIZATION:</b> The preceding steps may ultimately culminate in the denial of our shared humanity. Members of the targeted group may be equated with animals, vermin, insects or diseases. In so doing, the lust for their murder and persecution is no longer reined in by human revulsion. This is especially if hate propaganda further vilifies the victim group. Importantly, incitement to genocide should not be mixed with the idea of free speech. While the latter is rooted in protecting dissent so as to enrich democratic discussions and ideals, the former is disinterested in engaging in genuine dialogue. Hate-related crimes and institutions, like hate radio stations and publications, should be shut down and punished.</p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify"><b>5. ORGANIZATION:</b> In translating sentiments into actions, genocides occur when there is an organization. Frequently, the state is behind it and militias are often used to defuse and denial state culpability. Whether formal or informal, and centralized or decentralized, these organizations are often armed, trained and intentionally prepared for genocidal killings. The prevention and outlawing of membership in these militias is therefore the solution. Because these are often state-sanctioned, international action is paramount. The leaders of these militias should be denied visas for foreign travel; there should be arms embargoes on the perpetrators of genocide; and commissions must be created to investigate violations so as to send the message that justice is always served.</p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify"><b>6. POLARIZATION:</b> These organizations then try to entrench their views into society through further polarization. Extremists, through hate speech and laws that discourage and even forbid cross-group social interactions, can intimidate and silence the center. Some moderates from the perpetrators’ own group are even arrested and killed, because they may otherwise be able to stop genocide. The society takes on a brutal logic, where murders are justified by the need for genocide. To prevent this stage, security protection and assistance to moderate leaders and human rights groups are essential.</p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify"><b>7.  PREPARATION:</b>  To prepare the society for their “Final Solution,” national or perpetrator group leaders may cloak their intentions with euphemisms. In so doing, they set the stage for “ethnic cleansing,” “purification,” and “counter-terrorism.”  There is an indoctrination of fear, because “if we don’t kill them, they will kill us.” They may also build up their armies by training troops and purchasing arms. Arms embargoes can slow down their preparations and investigation commissions can determine whether there exists incitement and conspiracy to commit genocide. These are both crimes under Article 3 of the Genocide Convention and the group leaders can be prosecuted.</p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify"><b>8. PERSECUTION:</b> At this stage, victims are segregated. They are identified and placed on death lists, or forced to wear markers of their ethnic or religious identity. Sometimes they are even sent into ghettos, concentration camps, or food-starved regions. Genocidal massacres commence, where part of the group is intentionally destroyed. It is imperative that a Genocide Emergency be declared. The mobilization of the international community to assist the victim group and prepare it for its self-defense, and the threat of an armed international intervention are possible solutions. A potential refugee crisis may also occur and should be planned for.</p>

                              <p style="text-align:justify"><b>9. EXTERMINATION:</b> Killings on a large-scale begins, frequently by the militias. There may even be bilateral genocides, where revenge killings result in both groups persecuting each other (as in Burundi). Rapid and overwhelming armed intervention is necessary to stop genocide. Within the context of “might is right,” safe areas or refugee escape corridors need to be accompanied by heavily armed international protection - otherwise, they will only become zones of concentrated mass murder. The U.N. must intervene to authorize a multilateral force; if not, regional alliances must act. The genocidal state’s claim of “sovereignty” is tenuous and intervention, whether direct or indirect, is justified.</p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify"><b>10. DENIAL:</b> The final stage is denial. History is suppressed. While the victims of trauma should not be forced to speak out before they are ready, the perpetrators must be made to face up to their crimes so as to prevent further genocidal massacres. There is a tendency to cover up the evidence by intimidating witnesses, burning dead bodies or digging up mass graves. Sometimes, the victims are also blamed; the narrative is consciously distorted so as to preserve their power and legitimacy. These acts must not go unchallenged. Otherwise, they will remain with impunity, like Pol Pot in Cambodia. International tribunal or national courts must uphold justice and punish perpetrators. The past cannot be changed, but a show of solidarity and commitment to justice and truth can prevent future genocides.</p>
