                              <p style="text-align:justify">The Khmer Rouge government was overthrown on 7 January 1979, after the Third Indochina War when Vietnam invaded on Christmas Day in 1978, following a series of violent border confrontations. The People’s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) was established, and in 1989, the PRK was renamed the State of Cambodia. Even after the fall of the Khmer Rouge, everyday Cambodians suffered; many continued to die of starvation or diseases, and many died from stepping on the land mines that the Khmer Rouge had placed along the Western border to prevent victims from fleeing to Thailand. Violence and instability persisted.</p>

                              <p style="text-align:justify">The upper leadership of the party fled to the jungles, but remained active - Pol Pot continued to lead the Khmer Rouge as an insurgency. Many foreign entities, regardless of whether they were in the Soviet bloc or considered in the West, supported the Khmer Rouge. They blamed Vietnam for “creating the Cambodia problem” rather than applauding it for intervening in a genocide. As such, the Khmer Rouge retained their seat on the UN until 1993.</p>

                              <h6 style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">The Vietnamese overthrew Pol Pot, too, driving the leader to the Thai border where he continued to head the Khmer Rouge in the jungles.</h6>

                               <p style="text-align: justify">Pol Pot was sentenced to house arrest in his jungle home in July 1997, in what is widely considered to be a show trial. He died in April 1998. His death without severe punishment meant that the millions of deaths were not avenged and the wounds of the trauma he created were not healed.</p>
                               <p style="text-align: justify">Cambodia slowly opened up to the international community. With that, the atrocities that were committed during the regime became better known as survivors told their stories. Notably, The Killing Fields brought worldwide attention to the history of the Cambodian genocide to much acclaim. Even though decades have passed, the imprint of the genocide endures.</p>
