                              <p style="text-align:justify">The Khmer Rouge economic policy was to create a strong agricultural base, with smaller handicraft establishments and local industries. They severely neglected industrial growth, which other economies such as Vietnam and China focused far more on. The Khmer Rouge forced people into the countryside, where many were forced to work for 10-12 hours in unhealthy conditions. The goal was to create a completely self-sufficient industry.</p>

                              <p style="text-align:justify">Cambodia became a cashless industry, in which food rations became the main form of “economic transactions”. Food crises were constant and common, due to the unpredictability of harvests.</p>
                            

                              <p style="text-align:justify">Fortunately, Cambodia’s economy has developed a lot since the time of the Khmer Rouge. Today, while agriculture still forms a large part of the industry, industry and services now form over 60% of the Cambodian economy. This is couple with the fact that Cambodia has seen consistent GDP growth of about 7% over the last 4 years, with corresponding increases in GPD per capita.</p>
