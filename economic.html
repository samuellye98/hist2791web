                              <p style="text-align:justify">Since Cambodia’s independence in 1953, the economy is primarily characterized by a strong focus on agriculture and a lack of industrial development. Wet rice cultivation has traditionally played a key role in subsistence farming, national self-sufficiency in food production, as well as in public revenue. </p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify">When the Khmer Rouge came to power in 1975, it took over all private businesses and farms under the communist doctrine of collectivization. Money, private property, and private businesses were abolished; the central bank in Phnom Penh was demolished to move towards the Khmer Rouge’s vision of a cashless society; and the civilian population were organized into communes with collectivized ownership, production, and distribution. They severely neglected industrial growth, which other economies such as Vietnam and China focused far more on. Their radical transformation of the economy was part of their ‘agriculture-first’ policy to achieve industrial development with a strong, self-reliant agricultural foundation. Some observers have argued though that this was ‘back-to-nature’ primitivism instead. </p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify">In line with the economic goal of self-sufficiency, a Phnom Penh radio broadcast in early May (about a month after the Khmer Rouge arrived in the capital) boasted that the Khmer Rouge had used scrap iron and wrecked military vehicles to manufacture their own bullets and mines. Moreover, the regime announced a temporary measure on May 10 to ban foreigners from remaining in Cambodia. However, there were simultaneous conflicting reports that China was providing foreign aid to the Khmer Rouge. </p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify">The Khmer Rouge forced people into the countryside, where many were forced to work for 10-12 hours in unhealthy conditions. This was motivated by the regime’s hostility at the urban population as well as their urgency to rebuild the economy. This overnight evacuation of approximately 2 million residents from Phnom Penh occurred on April 17, 1975, immediately after the Khmer Rouge gained power. When the civilians reached the countryside, they were made to begin building up the country’s agricultural economy, starting by digging irrigation canals, harvesting cops, and clearing the land. From the Khmer Rouge’s perspective, the people would be able to feed themselves from the crops they grow.  </p>

                              <p style="text-align:justify">Fortunately, Cambodia’s economy has developed a lot since the time of the Khmer Rouge. Today, while agriculture still forms a large part of the industry, industry and services now form over 60% of the Cambodian economy. This is couple with the fact that Cambodia has seen consistent GDP growth of about 7% over the last 4 years, with corresponding increases in GPD per capita.</p>
