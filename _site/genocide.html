                              <h2>The Genocide</h2>
                         </div>

                              <p style="text-align:justify">The massacres began with the fighters who had resisted the Khmer Rouge regime during the civil war. Thereafter, the Khmer Rouge turned their attention towards civilians, rounding up anyone who was seen as a threat to the regime. There was a clear nationalist ideology to rid Cambodia of foreign influences. Those included people associated with Vietnam, the West, as well as ethnic minorities like Chinese, Thai, Lao, Vietnamese and Cham people. Any institution, religion or community that were seen as a threat to their political power were strategically annihilated. The elite ideology of those in power was that no one should be in a position to threaten that power. Pol Pot believed if people held the idea that anything other than the regime had some sort of power, then they would potentially rebel or threaten the regime’s validity. These also included people who were affiliated with Lon Nol’s regime or military, and anyone who opposed the Khmer Rouge regime or Pol Pot. </p>
                              <blockquote style="color: #DAA520">One of the Khmer Rouge mottos, in reference to the New People, was "To keep you is no benefit. To destroy you is no loss."</blockquote>
                              <p style="text-align:justify">The idea behind Year Zero was that all cultures and history within the Cambodian society should be destroyed and replaced with a new revolutionary culture that entrenches the Khmer Rouge’s political power. New people generally referred to people in urban areas, including teachers, artists, and intellectuals, who were specifically targeted and executed during the purges.  Some of the ex-elites, like former civil officials of the Lon Nol administration, heads of religious institutions and businessmen, were executed. The Khmer Rouge forced the urban population to abandon the cities of Cambodia so as to be resettled among the rural “base population” in the countryside. One of the Khmer Rouge mottos, in reference to the New People, was "To keep you is no benefit. To destroy you is no loss." The survivors walked into the countryside without food, water or medical care. Families were also broken up, with children being removed from their parents. Political and civil rights were abolished, in violation of the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights; a Khmer slogan which shows the frightening extent of inhumanity that pervades this period is “to spare you is no profit, to destroy you is no loss.”</p>

                               <p style="text-align: justify">No one was immune from being sent to the killing fields; many Khmer Rouge members were also executed on suspicion of disloyalty. Self-confessions were fabricated by the victims in the hopes that it would end their torture, but often did not stave off their deaths. False accusations were also made to receive more food rations - it was common for children to accuse their parents of crimes and, in so doing, sentenced their parents to death. The family was not the only institution that was targeted. Money was abolished, religion was outlawed, and schools were closed down. Total uniformity was imposed - everyone was to be dressed in black.</p>

                                         <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U7XBH0pPecE" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                               <p style="text-align: justify">There was also intensified violence against the ethnic minorities. More than half the ethnic Chinese population was wiped out - prompting Ben Kiernan to term it “the worst human disaster ever to befall the large ethnic Chinese community of Southeast Asia.” Most Vietnamese residents were forcibly expelled in 1975, and the remaining 10,000 or so were hunted down and murdered in 1977 and 1978. Chams were also subjected to deportation, starvation and death by overworking.</p>
                               <p style="text-align: justify">Cambodians who survived the purges and marches became forced laborers. Many of their survival depended on their ability to meet harsh daily quotas; the elderly, young, ill and handicapped were therefore often targets of the regime because of their inability to work. Whether it was death by starvation, overworking, illnesses or the killing fields, at least 1.5 million lives perished - 20% of the 7.5 million Cambodians in 1975. Perhaps the most sobering fact is that the international community remained largely ambivalent and was complicit in their lack of actions.</p>
