                              <h2>Educational Impacts</h2>

                              <p style="text-align:justify">Before the Khmer Rouge party took power, Prince Sihanouk placed emphasis on an educated society – this changed rapidly when the Khmer Rouge took power. Although more than 40 years have passed since the end of the Khmer Rouge’s regime, evidence of the genocide’s destruction is still present in modern Cambodian society. The education system in Cambodia is severely impeded due to the long-lasting effects of the trauma permeating throughout society. Many children in developing Cambodia remain without access to the basic human right of fundamental education. Despite the efforts of thousands of education-oriented NGOs, the progress of education development since the 1980s has been inadequate. This is due to three main factors: the Khmer Rouge’s crusade against the educated class, Cambodia’s focus on an agrarian economy, and a general distrust in the public education system.</p>


                              <p style="text-align:justify">The importance of childhood education was destroyed with the targeted purge against Cambodia’s educated class. The educated class was viewed as a threat by Pol Pot, who organized a crusade against all intellectuals, professors, businesspeople, and college-educated citizens. With the demise of the most educated echelon in Cambodia came a downfall in the importance of childhood education. In 2017, after anti-cheating reforms were introduced into the country’s national exam, 70% of the students sitting for the exam failed. With a much higher student to teacher ratio than its Southeast Asian neighbors, Vietnam and Laos, the country still has a long road to recovery ahead of it.</p>

                              <img src="static/images/ed2.png" style="display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" class="img-responsive" alt="Blog Image 3">
                              <h6 style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Comparison of student to teacher ratio in different Southeast Asian countries.</h6>
                              </div>
                              <p style="text-align:justify">Moreover, with a primarily agrarian economy based largely on rice production, most Cambodian children are forced to work in their families’ rice fields at a young age rather than attend daily school. In 2001, nearly 25 years after the genocide, only 25% or survey respondents replied that they had any form of secondary schooling. There was still 20% who had never received any education at all.</p>

                              <p style="text-align:justify">The striking shortcomings of Cambodia’s public education system are illuminated when comparing the small country to its Western neighbor, Thailand. Thailand maintains an adult literacy level of 94% while Cambodia falls short at only 77%. Furthermore, while Thai children benefit from accessible secondary and higher education institutions both in the city and in rural areas, only 2% of Cambodian villages have a secondary school accessible to their children. As one Thai teacher working in Cambodia explained, “In Thailand the children have dreams to go to university, and many of them do. In Cambodia, the children are not allowed to dream like this. This dream is unheard of.” Sadly, the genocide has set Cambodia far behind Thailand and many of its other Asian neighbors.</p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify">With a lack of trust in government-sponsored schools and a collective encouragement to abandon dreams of college for a life in the rice fields, Cambodian children face insurmountable challenges. Unfortunately, this sad truth is the price they pay for their country’s tragic history. In such a picturesque country with such beautiful people, darkness still looms. Each day, new human remains continue to surface just as each day new children leave the classroom for a life of hard manual labor. The effects of Pol Pot’s regime are as present as ever.</p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify">Recently, however, Cambodia has taken steps towards improving their education system, increasing the basic wage paid to teachers and investing more in the education sector. Hopefully, this leads to positive change in the near future.</p>
