                              <p style="text-align:justify">“No peace without justice”. Unfortunately, despite leading some of the most horrific killings and one of the worst mass killings of the 20th century, only 3 Khmer Rouge leaders were ever sentenced. In August 2014, Nuon Chea - considered Brother Number 2 to Pol Pot - and the regime's head of state Khieu Samphan were jailed for life for crimes against humanity. These were the only convictions for genocide after the whole ordeal. Pol Pot, leader of the Khmer Rouge party was sentenced to house arrest in 1997 and died a year later, denying millions of those who suffered under his regime the chance to gain any justice. All that was held in 1997 was a show trial in which former comrades of Pol Pot denounced him. Many of the other higher echelon leaders retreated into the countryside after the Vietnamese invasion and were unfortunately, gradually forgotten. In turn, many survivors are unable to attain closure from the horrific events they were put through. </p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify">Many survivors of the genocide suffer from post-traumatic symptoms, especially those who witnessed firsthand the death of their family members. The largest concentration of Cambodians lives in the city of Lowell in the United States. The problem of intergenerational trauma permeates deeply through this community, with issues such as child abuse and domestic violence. Aid workers report several accounts of physical or sexual abuse amongst youth. In one story in 1995, a former Khmer Rouge soldier went to his girlfriend's house and brutally murdered three of her four children. One daughter survived after her brother jumped in front of her and took 14 bullets. Another recounted how a mother held a rifle to her daughter with the imperative: 'Leave or die'. As a result, many Cambodian youth have experienced the effects of intergenerational trauma through their parents. </p>
                              <p style="text-align:justify">As 70% of Cambodians today were born to parents who were likely to have experienced severe trauma, there is a prevalence of PTSD and higher anxiety and depression in these families. A 2008 nationwide survey with a randomised sample of 1,000 Cambodian adults by the Berkeley's Human Rights Center, showed that of those respondents who lived under the KR regime, 14.9% showed symptoms of PTSD and 11.6% demonstrated symptoms of depression. Respondents born after the regime showed a prevalence of PTSD of 12.6% and depression of 6.7%.</p>
